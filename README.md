#Solar Panel Tracking System
Aim
The aim of this project is to design a solar panel tracking system that optimizes the efficiency of solar energy capture by continuously following the movement of the sun throughout the day. This system will utilize Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), servo motors, and an Arduino microcontroller to achieve precise and autonomous solar panel positioning.

The specific objectives are as follows:

Sun Tracking: Implement a sun tracking algorithm that calculates the sun's position based on LDR sensor data and adjusts the orientation of the solar panels accordingly.

Efficiency Enhancement: Ensure that the solar panels are always perpendicular to the incoming sunlight, maximizing energy capture throughout the day.

Autonomous Operation: Develop a reliable and autonomous system that requires minimal human intervention once set up.

Real-Time Monitoring: Incorporate real-time monitoring and data logging capabilities to track the system's performance and energy generation.

User-Friendly Interface: Create a user interface (UI) that allows users to configure system parameters, monitor energy generation, and manually control the system if needed.

Energy Efficiency: Optimize the power consumption of the system to ensure it operates efficiently using solar energy.

Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation to enable easy replication and customization of the system for other users and researchers.

Safety: Implement safety features to protect the system from adverse weather conditions and prevent damage to the equipment.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to create an intelligent solar panel tracking system that maximizes energy generation, contributing to a sustainable and eco-friendly energy source.
