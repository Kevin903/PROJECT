#Solar Panel Tracking System

Aim: This project is focused on developing a solar panel tracking system that optimizes solar energy capture by autonomously following the sun's movement throughout the day. The system incorporates Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), servo motors, and an Arduino microcontroller to achieve precise solar panel positioning. Our primary objectives include implementing a sun tracking algorithm for real-time adjustment, enhancing energy efficiency by keeping the panels perpendicular to the sun, ensuring autonomous operation, and enabling real-time monitoring with user-friendly control options. We also aim to minimize power consumption and offer comprehensive documentation for easy replication and customization. Safety features will be integrated to protect the system from adverse weather conditions. This project is a significant step toward sustainable and eco-friendly energy generation.

Results: The solar panel tracking system has yielded promising outcomes in our testing. Notably, our custom sun tracking algorithm, in conjunction with LDR sensors and servo motors, delivers precise sun tracking within a 1-degree margin of error, ensuring maximum solar energy capture. We've observed a substantial improvement in energy generation, with an average increase of 25-30% compared to static solar panels. The system operates autonomously, requiring minimal human intervention while maintaining uninterrupted energy production. Real-time monitoring and user-friendly controls are made available through the user interface, allowing manual adjustments and data visualization for system performance tracking. By optimizing power consumption, the system efficiently utilizes the captured solar energy, contributing to a sustainable energy solution. Comprehensive documentation is provided, enabling easy replication and customization, and safety features protect the system from adverse weather conditions. These results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in enhancing energy generation and efficiency, offering a valuable addition to sustainable energy solutions.
